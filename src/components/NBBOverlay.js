      <h3>The Client</h3>
        <p>North Bridger Bison is a family-owned bison ranch located in the heart of Montana, USA, renowned for its commitment to animal welfare and community-oriented business practices. They offer high-quality bison meat in large quantities to a variety of customers, from health-conscious chefs to large families simply looking to save money on groceries.</p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Despite their extensive media exposure through magazines, a Netflix documentary, and podcasts, North Bridger Bisons’ notable reputation was not translating into sustainable revenue to support and expand their business. The owner of North Bridger Bison partnered with my Computer Science and Ecommerce class to explore the many avenues in which to increase sales. Through exploring their Google Analytics, I identified a significant factor contributing to this obstacle: the inadequacy of their current website, which, despite generating substantial traffic, struggled to convert visitors into sales.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I took on the task to redesign North Bridger Bison’s existing website to not only reflect their brand identity and build a faithful following, but also encourage customers to complete their purchases. As a student, I was under a two-week time constraint with zero budget.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>The solution entailed user interviews, SEO analysis, and a redesign of North Bridger Bison’s website, focusing on improving product visibility and building trust with users. Through navigation reorganization, call-to-action buttons, visual aids, and refined content, the new website designs aim to streamline the purchasing process and reassure visitors that they are making a worthwhile purchase.</p>
        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p><h5>Research and Analysis</h5></p>
        <li>I conducted interviews with potential customers to understand their preferences and customer journeys regarding bison meat in Montana. Users expressed a strong interest in having a mobile-friendly design, streamlining navigation, and including visual aids for price comparison and storage requirements.</li>
        <p><h5>Client Consultation</h5></p>
        <li>Our class engaged in discussions with the business owner (via Zoom) to grasp their vision and key objectives for their business, including a website redesign. He had little expectations and was open to any design directions.</li>
        <p><h5>Wireframing</h5></p>
        <li>I then developed initial wireframes in Adobe XD to outline the website's structure and layout, reorganizing the site map for an improved user journey.</li>
        <p><h5>Prototyping</h5></p>
        <li>High-fidelity mockups in AdobeXD walk through the basic user flow of all website pages. In this step, I paid special attention to the copy, buttons, tabs, and product listings. These mockups offered a detailed representation of the recommended website improvements.</li>
        <h3>The Results</h3>
        <p>I presented the redesigned website to North Bridger Bison, who proceeded to implement numerous changes based on my advice. This resulted in a revamped online platform that effectively showcased their products, addressed mobile optimization concerns, and provided a streamlined user experience for customers. North Bridger Bisons’ feedback was overwhelmingly positive and thankful.</p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p><h5>User Research</h5><li>Prioritizing user research was crucial in crafting a design that resonated with the target audience. I found that the ideal client was much more diverse than I initially would have design for.</li>
        <h5>Addressing Pain Points</h5><li>Emphasizing clear FAQs and visual aids helped cultivate trust with customers, mitigating friction points in the customer journey and bolstering confidence in the purchasing in such a large quantity.</li></p>
