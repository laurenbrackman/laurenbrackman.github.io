      <h3>The Client</h3>
        <p>Elevate Fitness Training, a private fitness facility in Hamilton, MT, sought a modern and user-friendly website to attract clients and promote new fitness class offerings.</p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>They needed a comprehensive, visually appealing site that seamlessly integrated with their existing fitness management system, ZenPlanner.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As the web designer, I was tasked with designing, developing, and deploying the new website. I worked under a one month time constraint while managing a full-time job.</p>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>I created a sleek, modern website on Wix, incorporating a vibrant red accent color, bold yet readable fonts, and a custom favicon. I curated all the copy and photos on the website to promote clear and consistent messaging. Responsive and accessible design was a priority throughout my development process.</p>
        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <li>I began with mood boarding to understand the client’s aesthetic preferences. This involved selecting colors and fonts that aligned with the brand’s identity, as well as creating a distinctive favicon.</li>
        <li>Next, I developed wireframes to outline the structure and layout of the website, ensuring a logical flow and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li>I then created complete designs in Figma to fine-tune all the details before development.</li>
        <li>After transferring plans and domains, I published the site and began monitoring traffic for improvements, with plans to connect pages to a CMS for easier updates.</li>
        <h3>The Results</h3>
        <p>The new website effectively represents Elevate Fitness Training’s brand, enhances user experience, and has started attracting more traffic.</p>
